- Configuration of fonts and color palettes to ensure a harmonious and accessible visual identity.
- Relational database modeling using **Prisma ORM**.
- Implementation of the cloud database with **Neon Serverless Postgres**.
- Structuring tables to store information about:
  - Restaurants
  - Menu categories
  - Available products

### 2️⃣ Main Interface Construction
- Development of the screen for choosing the order type (**takeout or dine-in**).
- Implementation of the menu category screen, listing the products registered in the database.
